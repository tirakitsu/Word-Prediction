# Word-Prediction
Word Prediction Program created with keras and numpy, after initialization, it will tell the user to input the name of the corpus (the one provided is humpty dumpty, though it can be edited to be something else). It will then ask the user to input a word model, or if it needs to train a new one. There is one provided, in the file, however the option to create a new one was provied in case there was an issue with the output. Then it asks the user for an input, which has to be something included in the corpus file, which can be edited. It next asks the user to enter the numbre of words to predict, though the lower the number, the more accurate it tends to be. After inputting the number of words to predict, it will output its prediction.
